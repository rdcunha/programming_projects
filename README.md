# Programming Projects

This repository contains my code for the Crawford group programming projects, found here:

[CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects)

## Current completed projects:
* Project 1: Molecular Geometry Analysis
* Project 2: Harmonic Vibrational Analysis
* Project 3: HF-SCF
* Project 4: MP2 Energy
* Project 5: CCSD Energy
* Project 6: CCSD(T) Energy
* Project 8: DIIS extrapolation for SCF

The code uses [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), the C++ template library for linear algebra. It must be compiled with a C++11 compiler and include the directory for Eigen.
